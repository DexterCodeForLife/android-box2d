This is Doug's port of the Box2D framework to the Android NDK. It is also a showcase of how to use the CDT with the regular Android Java plugins for native development.

To import the projects properly, you need to install Eclipse into your regular Eclipse install. Galileo is highly recommended for this (and is what I use).

The Makefiles assume the NDK is installed under C:/Android. Change the ANDROID_NDK_BASE build macro if it is not. Also the CDT adds C:/cygwin/bin to the PATH environment variable. This can be changed in the C/C++ Build settings under Environment.

Contact me if you need any help and I'll update this README with better instructions.
